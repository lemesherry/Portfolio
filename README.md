### ABOUT ME:

#### I work as a bot developer at **`Discord`** and currently I am enrolled as a **`Junior Unity Developer`** program by **`Gametrain`** sponsored by **`Generation Pakistan`**.

#### I love working with *__Arch Linux__* and open-source software. I write the easiest understandable code just like `Martin Fowler` said: `“`Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.`”`

#### Programming languages that I know are:

  * JavaScript (Node)
  * C++
  * C#
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * PHP
 
#### My Interests:

 > * Constantly learning and improving my self.
 > * Learning new programming languages and try to build a program in that language.
 > * Messing around with linux :P
 > * Explore more in unity and other APIs that I have used ( i.e. Youtube, Spotify, Discord ).
